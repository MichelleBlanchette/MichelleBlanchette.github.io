Poor video performance often leads BuddyBoss site owners to use third-party video embeds via YouTube or Vimeo. However, this requires the user to upload and host their videos from another platformâ€”a platform they do not own nor have control over. This is an unacceptable solution for site visitor-uploaded content, which occurs directly on the business&#8217;s BuddyBoss WordPress website.

Using <a href="https://www.mux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Mux API</a>, I was able to bring video optimizations to WordPress, including normalized audio tracks. I developed a custom WordPress plugin that uploads new videos to Mux and caches the Mux asset data to the site. To ensure the cached asset data is always current, I implemented a custom REST endpoint to process Mux webhook events. The endpoint is secured by <a href="https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/verify-webhook-signatures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verifying each request&#8217;s signature</a>.

To achieve a seamless frontend experience, I implemented JavaScript that collects video source URLs that are not hosted via Mux. The video posters are replaced with a &#8220;Processing Video&#8221; loader gif image while the JavaScript continuously checks each Mux asset&#8217;s status. Once the static renditions are ready, the JavaScript sets the video source to the Mux playback URL and removes the &#8220;processing&#8221; poster.
