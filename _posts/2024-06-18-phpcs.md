title: "Drove 85%+ Code Quality Improvement with Restored PHPCS Integration"
---

When I joined DentalPlans.com, the PHP codebase lacked consistency and clarity which made it difficult to develop efficiently. Although PHP_CodeSniffer (phpcs) was technically installed, it wasnâ€™t functioning properly with our editors or surfacing issues in day-to-day development.

I fixed the PHPCS integration with VS Code and ensured our coding standards were correctly recognized and enforced during development. This brought instant visibility to style issues and gave the team real-time feedback loops that naturally reinforced cleaner code without policing.

After 4 months, code quality violations dropped by 70% despite continuous development, with the codebase sitting at 85% improvement 1 year later. This made a significant shift toward long-term maintainability and the team's velocity.
