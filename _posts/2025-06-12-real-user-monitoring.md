title: "Enabled Strategic Prioritization Through Real User Monitoring Insights"
short: |
    If you don't have proper real-user monitoring in place, how can you possibly prioritize and strategize? 🤨

    **I single-handedly implemented the system and shareable real-time dashboards for a $30MM+ business.** 📊

    Sure enough, a couple days later, fire alarms went off. 🚨

    Marketers were lamenting a poor UX they discovered, engineers were scrambling to deflect blame, product managers were frantically designing resolution strategy—and then there was me, calmly checking my reports and instantly revealing that **the undesirable UX was literally impacting <0.3% experiences...** 🧘‍♀️

    My insights _immediately_ de-escalated the issue, saving countless hours across multiple departments, and **returning focus to actual productivity.** 👩‍💻

At DentalPlans.com, I observed that prioritization was often reactive, driven by anecdotal edge cases rather than real user impact. This led to frequent fire drills over issues with unclear scope or significance.

To address this, I designed and deployed a real user monitoring (RUM) strategy that surfaced quantifiable experience data in a format accessible to stakeholders across engineering, marketing, product, and leadership.

**Within days, this system revealed that a recently escalated concern affected less than 0.3% of users.** This insight immediately saved the team countless hours and has consistently enabled a shift toward initiatives with greater business value ever since.
