I wanted to track Asana assignments related to my WordPress website as I worked on it. To my amazement, a specialized solution had not been built yet, despite [an obvious need in the market](https://forum.asana.com/t/wordpress-and-asana/1092).

Ever since then, I have worked on my own solution to integrate Asana tasks with WordPress. Completionist is a WordPress plugin that I offer for [free download](https://purpleturtlecreative.com/completionist/) which features a dashboard widget, post edit panel (aka “metabox”), and custom automations.

Despite being a pretty small project thus far with minimal efforts to make its presence known, Completionist has received some notable attention:

- [Original announcement post in the Asana Community Forum](https://forum.asana.com/t/wordpress-and-asana/1092/10?u=michelle_blanchette) received (and continuously receives) a high number of clicks—currently 300+ clicks counted.
- Added to ["The ultimate guide for doing things with Asana"](https://forum.asana.com/t/the-ultimate-guide-for-doing-things-with-asana/32548) integration listing post in the Asana Community Forum, managed by Forum Leader and Asana Partner, Bastien Siebman.
- Featured as the top Asana-to-WordPress integration on WP Forms in their blog post ["7 Top Asana Integrations for 2021"](https://wpforms.com/top-asana-integrations/#wordpress).
