“Deal of the Day” (aka DOTD) is a promotional program that features a business’s product across The Houston Chronicle’s websites. The goal of the feature was to inspire urgency for site visitors to claim the deal within a limited timeframe.

Using JavaScript, I built the eye-catching countdown timer component and displayed it throughout notable areas of [Chron Shopping](https://www.chron.com/shopping/). The [Chron.com](https://www.chron.com/) homepage, which receives thousands of site visitors every day, also featured the countdown timer component.

Lastly, I implemented the refreshed design for the Deal of the Day post template. The countdown timer was prominently featured at the top of these pages as well.
