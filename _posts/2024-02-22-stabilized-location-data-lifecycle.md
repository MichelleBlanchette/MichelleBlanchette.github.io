title: "Stabilized Location Data Lifecycle to Eliminate Race Conditions and Fragility"

Accurate location detection is essential to ensure DentalPlans.com displays correct pricing and availability based on a visitorâ€™s geography. During a technical audit, I uncovered race conditions and sequencing flaws in the location lifecycle, leading to unstable behavior and inconsistent plan data which directly eroded user trust.

I refactored the underlying flow by clarifying the business logic and introducing a controlled signaling mechanism. This allowed dependent systems to reliably respond to location changes without redundant polling or fragile conditional checks. A custom event hook replaced ad hoc triggers, simplifying state management across the app.

Since this overhaul, the location system has remained stable without further maintenance. Developers now build on top of it with confidence, accelerating feature delivery instead of reworking brittle edge cases.
