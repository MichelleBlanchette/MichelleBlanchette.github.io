While reviewing HTTP error logs for DentalPlans.com, I noticed a disproportionate number of `400 Bad Request` responses originating from the marketing website’s calls to the Savings Calculator API. Many requests included clearly bogus values like “Snag your free gift” and “Claim your free Bitcoin,” indicating form-stuffing by bots targeting lead-generation forms.

I identified consistent patterns in these malformed requests and implemented robust pre-request validation to filter out bad actors before they ever reached the API service.

Following deployment, monitoring confirmed a complete elimination of these spammy inputs to the microservice, resulting in a 75.6% drop in overall `400` responses and improved API reliability.
