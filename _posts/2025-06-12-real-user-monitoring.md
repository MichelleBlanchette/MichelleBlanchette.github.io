title: "Enabled Strategic Prioritization Through Real User Monitoring Insights"
short: "My insights _immediately_ de-escalated an identified issue which saved us countless hours across multiple departments and **returned focus to real productivity.**"

At DentalPlans.com, I observed that prioritization was often reactive, driven by anecdotal edge cases rather than real user impact. This led to frequent fire drills over issues with unclear scope or significance.

To address this, I designed and deployed a real user monitoring (RUM) strategy that surfaced quantifiable experience data in a format accessible to stakeholders across engineering, marketing, product, and leadership.

**Within days, this system revealed that a recently escalated concern affected less than 0.3% of users.** This insight immediately saved the team countless hours and has consistently enabled a shift toward initiatives with greater business value ever since.
