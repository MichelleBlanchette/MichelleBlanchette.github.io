title: "Fully Resolved 25,000+ Indexing Issues by Correcting Technical SEO Strategy"
short: |
    **Top-tier technical SEO agencies _still_ aren't using `robots.txt` correctly.** I'm ripping off 10 years of back-and-forth, band-aid solutions from numerous top-tier marketing agencies and immediately addressing the root issues. üßê

    **As an API integration specialist, I know how to get machines to talk to each other.**

    To kick things off, I just reversed and fully resolved a runaway 25,000+ indexing issue. By _correctly_ and _completely_ resolving this issue, the company will no longer need to waste time on this as they have been for 10+ years!

While monitoring Search Console coverage reports for DentalPlans.com, I noticed a sharp upward trend in ‚ÄúIndexed, though blocked by robots.txt‚Äù warnings. Although some consultants considered it non-critical, I recognized that it was unintentionally exposing personalized checkout URLs in public search results.

Upon reviewing `robots.txt` configurations across properties, I traced the issue to blanket `Disallow: /` directives intended to reduce crawl activity on non-SEO domains. To resolve it, I implemented `noindex, nofollow` meta tags across these sites and removed the blocking rules to allow bots visibility of the directives.

After peaking at over 25,000 URLs, the indexing issue was completely resolved and crawl activity remained low across the affected domains.
