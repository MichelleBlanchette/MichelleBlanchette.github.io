I wanted to track Asana assignments related to my WordPress website as I worked on it. To my amazement, a specialized solution had not been built yet, despite <a href="https://forum.asana.com/t/wordpress-and-asana/1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an obvious need in the market.</a>

Ever since then, I have worked on my own solution to integrate Asana tasks with WordPress. Completionist is a WordPress plugin that I offer for <a href="https://purpleturtlecreative.com/completionist/">free download</a> which features a dashboard widget, post edit panel (aka &#8220;metabox&#8221;), and custom automations.

Despite being a pretty small project thus far with minimal efforts to make its presence known, Completionist has received some notable attention:
