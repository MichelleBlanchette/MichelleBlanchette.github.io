title: "Cut First Contentful Paint by 45% with Targeted Script Load Optimizations"
short: "My loading strategy optimizations of first-party scripts **improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by 65%, First Contentful Paint (FCP) by 45%, and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by 83%.** 🏎️💨"

After auditing frontend performance on DentalPlans.com, I discovered that several first-party scripts were unnecessarily blocking rendering. These scripts were loaded too early, had tangled dependency chains, and weren’t leveraging modern load strategies like `defer`.

I refactored the load order and resolved the dependency issues to ensure essential content could render without delay.

These changes dramatically improved front-end performance:
- **First Contentful Paint** dropped **45.4%** (8.793s → 4.797s)
- **Largest Contentful Paint** improved by **65.8%** (16.092s → 5.495s)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift** was nearly eliminated (0.844 → 0.142)
- **Total Blocking Time** saw a modest reduction (14.43s → 13.83s)

The result was a faster, more stable page load experience&mdash;which is especially critical for SEO and conversion.
