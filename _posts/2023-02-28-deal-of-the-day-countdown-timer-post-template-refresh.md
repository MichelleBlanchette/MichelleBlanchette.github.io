&#8220;Deal of the Day&#8221; (aka DOTD) is a promotional program that features a business&#8217;s product across The Houston Chronicle&#8217;s websites. The goal of the feature was to inspire urgency for site visitors to claim the deal within a limited timeframe.

Using JavaScript, I built the eye-catching countdown timer component and displayed it throughout notable areas of <a href="https://www.chron.com/shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chron Shopping</a>. The <a href="https://www.chron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chron.com</a> homepage, which receives thousands of site visitors every day, also featured the countdown timer component.

Lastly, I implemented the refreshed design for the Deal of the Day post template. The countdown timer was prominently featured at the top of these pages as well.
